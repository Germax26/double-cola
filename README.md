# Double Cola

Implementation of [Double Cola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fylNa2wZaU) in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

[Tsoding.hs](/tsoding.hs) is Tsoding's Haskell solution verbatim except for the main function, which has been modified to show the test cases of n=1, n=52, and n=10010. The main function of [my solution](/dc.hs) also shows these test cases.
